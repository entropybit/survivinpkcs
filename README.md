# Modeling of Survivin - PKCS - Survivin complexes.

This repository holds the scripts that were used for the modeling done 
for the publication *Spatial and functional interaction of a 
heterotetramer Survivin-DNA-PKcs complex in DNA double-strand break repair* 
(Submitted). 


The basis for the here documented modeling steps were [1E31](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1E31) for Survivin
and [5LUQ](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5LUQ) for the DNA-PKcs.
After an initial loop modeling using [Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/) a closed structure can be found for the
Kinase and FAT Domain of DNA-PKcs, which we called [head](https://github.com/entropybit/survivinpkcs/blob/master/pdbs/pkcs_head.pdb) structure in the paper. As the other domains contain a large gap of missing structural information
which can not be closed with loop modeling, only those two Domains were used as model for the DNA-PKcs.
This was sufficient as investigating the interaction of Survivin with the PI3K region was aim of this work. 
From perliminary docking with the Schr√∂dinger suite, the best two poses were available.
For these poses, we see very different positions of Survivin relative to its docking partner. 
However, mutational studies on the Survivin residues being closest to the PI3K region, showed that exactly
these two poses are important for the binding. 
Therefore the idea was, that these are fulfilled by Survivin binding in according poses to two
DNA-PKcs Proteins. An [initial structure](https://github.com/entropybit/survivinpkcs/blob/master/pdbs/kinase_heterodimer_aligned_0001.pdb) for this was generated by aligning both poses on Survivin accordingly.
