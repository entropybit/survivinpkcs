# Modeling of Survivin - PKCS - Survivin complexes.

This repository holds the scripts that were used for the modeling done 
for the publication *Spatial and functional interaction of a 
heterotetramer Survivin-DNA-PKcs complex in DNA double-strand break repair* 
(Submitted). 


The basis for the here documented modeling steps were [1E31](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1E31) for Survivin
and [5LUQ](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5LUQ) for the DNA-PKcs.
After an initial loop modeling using [Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/) a closed structure can be found for the
Kinase and FAT Domain of DNA-PKcs. As the other domains contain a large gap of missing structural information
which can not be closed with loop modeling, only those two Domains were used as model for the DNA-PKcs.
Which was sufficient as the interaction of Survivin with the PI3K region had been investigated in this work.
