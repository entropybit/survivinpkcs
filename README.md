# Modeling of Survivin - PKCS - Survivin complexes.

This repository holds the scripts that were used for the modeling done 
for the publication *Spatial and functional interaction of a 
heterotetramer Survivin-DNA-PKcs complex in DNA double-strand break repair* 
(Submitted). 


The basis for the here documented modeling steps were the following protein structures:

    * Survivin, PDB: [1E31](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1E31)
    * DNA-PKcs, PDB: [5LUQ](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5LUQ)
